# Searching corpora in CHILDES for instances of 的 'de'
I wrote this to create a Pandas dataframe to analyze information about children's early productions of 的 in Mandarin Chinese, esp. when it occurs in non-sentence final position (i.e. the head NP has not been ellided). This is a work in progress – comments are welcome.
