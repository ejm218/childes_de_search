The Erbaugh corpus contains a total of 24,462 child utterances.

The earliest production of de in the Erbaugh corpus occurs at 22 months old, with 23 total findings across the available transcripts. Most of the utterances contain a covert NP or, alternatively, express affirmation of the previous utterance. In many of these cases, the different uses cannot be determined based on the utterance alone. For example, given the utterance below, two possible interpretations can be proposed: if the child is specifying a member of a previously-established set, e.g. "two paintings, one of which the sister painted," then this would be a case where the child has simply omitted the modified NP; on the other hand, if the child is simply repeating or affirming the statement "Sister painted," then they are using de as modal particle. In the second case, it is not being used to designate nominal modification, but rather as a homophonous sentence-final particle that takes scope over the utterance as a whole.

All de utterances from this time period appear to be either affirmations using the modal particle form in some cases, or omissions of the head NP. There are several instances where the child uses an adjectival modifier, such as xiao 'small,' followed by de sentence-finally. The underlying structure of these uses remains somewhat opaque: it could be that the modified NP is generated after de but subsequently moves to SpecIP. This is supported by the fact that an overt NP in a sentence like "这个苹果小小的__" is ungrammatical. Logically, this type of transformation would require the existence of the basic structure in the child's grammar; given the set of productions at this age, however, there is no evidence that the child has acquired (or at least has access to) the modifier + de + NP structure. It seems more likely that, at first, de's sole function is that of an affirmation particle.

At 23 months, however, the number of de utterances effectively doubles (N = 42) with two overt NP heads. The remaining utterances (N = 40) contain sentence-final de.

Both of these productions are direct imitations of adult speech, and given the scarcity, it seems reasonable to conclude that the modification function of de is not yet available to the child at 23 months old.

The number of utterances containing de more than triples between 23 and 24 months old, with 155 listed in the Erbaugh corpus at 24 months. At this point, we begin to see consistent use of de in non-sentence final positions, as well as with overt NPs. There are 21 such utterances in this data set, with 13 different NP tokens. Nearly of these are possessive phrases, e.g. 我的汽车, 我的爸爸, but one is clearly adjectival.

The number of utterances produced at 25 months and thereafter decreases drastically; there are a few possible explanations for this. One option is that, as seen in previous research on other acquisition types, after discovering a new structure in their language, the child experiences a period of intense fixation and over-produces the target structure. If this is the case, we might expect the number of de utterances to make up a considerably larger proportion of the speech acts compared with subsequent months.

At 29 months old, one child in the Erbaugh corpus uses de with several of different NPs. Although the majority of utterances (about 69%) still contain sentence-final de, a manual inspection of the data demonstrates that a number of these can potentially be categorized as cases of NP ellipsis, rather than affirmation.

At the same time, there is some evidence that the child's productivity remains limited. For example:

Peng/13.xml (2;05)
ADU1: 你 现在 要 做 什么
CHI: 要 做 屋顶 .
CHI: 睡觉 的 .
ADU1: 要 做 睡觉 的 屋顶 啊 ?
CHI: 嗯 .
CHI: 它 要 睡觉 的 .

In this dialogue, again, the first use of de by the child is unclear. It could be that ellipsis has occurred, or that the child is using de as a particle (which is clearly the case for the last utterance). Worth noting is that there appears to be some level of avoidance of the adult structure, where a VP modifies the target NP. In one case, though, the child successfully produces an object relative clause:

Peng/13 (2;05)
ADU1: 那 是 什么 ? ▶
"What's that?"
CHI: 头 . ▶
"A head"
ADU1: 头 是 什么 头 啊 ? ▶
"What head?"
CHI: 我 切 开 来 的 头 .
"The head I cut off"

This is the only time that the child produces such a construction at this age, however. At 30 months, the same child again produces two object relatives, one of which is more adultlike than the other:

Peng/14 (2;06)
ADU1: 那 是 谁 画 的 xxx .
CHI: 不 晓得 谁 画 的 蛇 .

Peng/15 (2;06)
ADU1: 这个 是 什么 东西 啊 ?
CHI: 这 是 椅子 .
ADU1: 椅子 啊 ?
CHI: 这 是 睡觉 的 地方 .
ADU1: 那 是 睡觉 的 椅子 啊 ? ▶
CHI: 嗯 . ▶

There is another increase in the total number of utterances from this corpus around 31 and 32 months old. At 31 months, exactly half of the utterances include a non-SF de (77 out of 154 total),  compared with just over 30% of non-SF productions at 29 months.

Almost 38% of the utterances at 32 months are non-SF. 42% for 33 months, 47% for 34 months, 40% for 35 months, etc...

All of the occurrences at 37 months come from the "Kang" dataset, and many seem to employ a similar formula; namely, the child uses a relativized IP with the determiner 那个 'that one'
